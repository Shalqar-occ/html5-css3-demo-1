<h1 style="color:black";><b>5.How does antivirus work?</b></h1><br>
<p style="color:tomato";>Antivirus software begins operating by checking your computer programs and <br>files against a database of known types of malware. Since new viruses are <br>constantly created and distributed by hackers, it will also scan computers for the <br>possibility of new or unknown type of malware threats.<br><br><br></p>
<P style="color:blue";>Typically, most programs will use three different detection devices: specific <br>detection, which identifies known malware; generic detection, which looks for<br> known parts or types of malware or patterns that are related by a common <br>codebase; and heuristic detection, which scans for unknown viruses by <br>identifying known suspicious file structures. When the program finds a file that <br>contains a virus, it will usually quarantine it and/or mark it for deletion, making it <br>inaccessible and removing the risk to your device.</p>
